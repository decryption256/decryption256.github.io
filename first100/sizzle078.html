<p><b>NEWS</b></p>

<p><b>Apple's new product event probably March 15th</b><br>
I generally try not to report on rumours like this in The Sizzle - there's no harm in waiting until it's a fact. But this rumour is so strong, I can't ignore it. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/02/02/apple-event-march-15">March 15th will see Apple announce</a> a new iPad Air, a 4" iPhone and some new Apple Watch bands. I'd be tempted to go the 4" iPhone if the camera is up to scratch. Maybe. It'll probably cost $1000 and Apple will call it their "mid-range" phone. My iPad Air 1st gen is still working fine, so unless the Air 3 is balls out amazing, might wait for the 3 to hit the refurb store.</p>

<p><b>Fine Bros decide not to enforce their trademark on reaction vids</b><br>
File this in the "we are totally oblivious to our own actions" category. The Fine Bros, who I mentioned only earlier this week decided to get a trademark on reaction videos, a genre of videos they feel they invented. After a few days of whiny YouTube "stars" yelling at the Fine Bros, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/2/10892812/the-fine-bros-reaction-video-trademark-abandon">they realised maybe what they're doing is infact, bad, not good and have rescinded their trademarks on reaction vids</a>.</p>

<p><b>Apple sold more iPad Pros than Microsoft sold Surfaces</b><br>
I honestly did not expect this - <a href="http://hexus.net/mobile/news/tablets/90218-apple-ipad-pro-outsold-entire-surface-line-last-quarter-says-idc/">according to IDC Apple sold 2 million iPad Pros last quarter and Microsoft sold 1.6 million Surfaces</a>. I would have thought that the Surface Pro would be king of the big screen tablets thanks to it being much more flexible. But I guess people really like the iOS ecosystem (which is better - Windows as anything other than a desktop OS is pretty lame).</p>

<p><b>Optus decides to sell the BlackBerry Priv</b><br>
There's probably one or two of you sick fucks out there who want to see what sort of monstrosity BlackBerry's Priv has devolved into. <a href="http://ausdroid.net/2016/02/03/blackberrys-priv-launches-with-optus-tomorrow/">This last ditch effort from BlackBerry goes on sale with Optus</a> (who really must be getting a sweet deal to bother having it take up valuable shelf space) tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>SwiftKey is now a Microsoft product</b><br>
The popular SwiftKey mobile keyboard app has been <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2016/02/02/microsoft-has-reportedly-acquired-mobile-keyboard-company-swiftkey-for-around-250m/">snapped up by Microsoft for US$250m</a>. Microsoft has a tendency to snap up these cool mobile apps, like Wunderlist, Sunrise and Acompli and actually not fuck them up, sometimes even making them better. I like this Microsoft.</p>

<p><b>COOL SHIT</b></p>

<p><b>15 years of VLC</b><br>
<a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html">VLC</a> is one of those apps that I've used day in, day out, for so long now, that I take it for granted. The damn thing plays back virtually any video type, works on every platform I can think of and costs nothing. What an amazing project and surely is a poster child for open source projects done right. <a href="https://www.jbkempf.com/blog/post/2016/15-years-of-VLC">15 years ago it was launched in the form we know it as now</a> and since then it's had over 2 billion downloads. Incredible success.</p>

<p><b>Dude made a Raspberry Pi tweet whenever his Internet is slow</b><br>
I hate slow Internet and I wish I thought of this back when I was having trouble with Optus. This Comcast customer in the USA has a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/43fi39/i_set_up_my_raspberry_pi_to_automatically_tweet/">Raspberry Pi running a simple script</a> that performs the CLI version of Speed Test and if the result is significantly under the 150/50 he's paying for, the script tweets at Comcast complaining it is slow.</p>

<p><b>Apple's confusing and scary 20th Anniversary Mac intro video</b><br>
If you remember the good old days of Mac OS X, where Apple would play an intro video with some cool music on the first boot after installing the new OS (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DSXz9xst5k">example</a>), you'll probably watch this video from the 20th Anniversary Mac intro vid and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwuK9m2G1J8">wonder what the hell was going on down in Cupertino the day this was burned to a disc</a>. People were so big on CD-ROMs, haha - they weren't that exciting, were they?</p>
