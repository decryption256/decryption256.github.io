<p><b>NEWS</b></p>

<p><b>Apple finally gets support from other tech companies against the FBI</b><br>
Microsoft, Google and Facebook have been relatively quiet on the whole "government getting up in my shit" topic since Apple's open letter, <a href="http://recode.net/2016/02/25/google-will-join-microsoft-in-backing-apple-with-a-legal-filing-in-fbi-case/">but they eventually stood up and will each file an amicus brief</a> (which is like a friend of the court thing) supporting Apple. Apple has filed their formal response to the FBI's request and as we could have guessed, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/02/25/apple-fbi-motion">have said they won't unlock the phone because law says they shouldn't have to</a> and the law the FBI is using to make them doesn't apply here. On the 1st of March, <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/02/25/apple-fbi-encryption-congressional-hearing">Apple's head lawyer will speak at a congressional committee</a> about this topic.</p>

<p><b>Foxconn to buy Sharp, almost</b><br>
You may have heard yesterday that Foxconn (the people who manufacture lots of electronics, including the iPhone) was going to buy Sharp (once a Japanese electronics powerhouse, now just a collection of patents and uncompetitive manufacturing facilities). It was announced just after I sent yesterday's issue out so I didn't cover it in the Sizzle, which might be a good thing, as the deal is on hold as <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/business/world-business/foxconns-hesitates-on-76-billion-bid-for-sharp-20160225-gn41hk.html">Foxconn received some new info about Sharp that might make it back out of the deal</a> or change its offer.</p>

<p><b>Attempt to improve NBN's operational transparency fails</b><br>
Considering how much tax money is spent on the NBN, it's very difficult to get information about what exactly they're doing out of the government corporation. To fix this, <a href="http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/594421/senate-seeks-greater-transparency-nbn-finances-rollout-forecasts/">an amendment to some legislation</a> was approved by the Senate to make the NBN reveal more of it's rollout data and financial info. <a href="http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/594808/nbn-transparency-measure-kyboshed-by-government/">It was blocked by the House of Representatives</a>. Whenever more transparency is knocked back, its always because someone has something to hide and is never a good thing.</p>

<p><b>Microsoft confirms its attempt to port Android apps to Windows isn't gonna happen</b><br>
Microsoft's main problem with its mobile platform efforts is the range and quality of apps. While there's loads of desktop apps for Windows, there's only a handful of quality ones for Windows smartphones and tablets. Developers just love iOS and Android. In an attempt to fix this issue, Microsoft announced <a href="http://www.winbeta.org/news/what-is-project-astoria-and-project-islandwood">Project Astoria</a> last year as a way to run Android apps on Windows smartphones. I thought it sounded too good to be true and <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/10096/microsoft-ends-effort-to-bring-android-apps-to-windows-10-mobile">unfortunately, I was right</a>. Microsoft did just announce that it <a href="http://www.winbeta.org/news/microsoft-buying-xamarin-is-a-big-deal-and-heres-why">purchased Xamarin though</a>, producer of an IDE that allows apps written in C# to run on multiple platforms.</p>

<p><b>The Ultranet IBAC hearing continues to expose significant bullshit</b><br>
People that worked for the Victorian Department of Education purchased shares in CSG, then a shitty IT provider, whilst on the board of the Ultranet project that just happened to pick CSG to deliver the $240m+ project across Victorian schools. <a href="http://www.itnews.com.au/news/ibac-hauls-first-saudi-based-witnesses-to-ultranet-hearings-415623">Wow, what a coincidence</a>. What shits me even more is that these rat fucks don't even care they were under investigation. Suspecting they were being recorded, <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/ex-education-department-official-admits-he-pushed-the-bloody-boundaries-20160225-gn3ese.html">one genius in the group said on the phone</a>, "Fuck them, fuck them, we've done nothing wrong. Jesus Christ. You're allowed to have a life" - what a great attitude to have when you're responsible for the education of our state's children.</p>

<p><b>COOL SHIT</b></p>

<p><b>DSE clearance has begun & Myer 10% off Macs</b><br>
The time to feast on Dick Smith's retail carcass has begun. Currently <a href="https://www.ozbargain.com.au/node/236344">DSE stores are offering tame deals</a> (20-30% off) whatever stock is left, but the real cheap stuff will happen closer to the liquidators deadline, which is apparently in 8 weeks. I'd hang out a little longer if I wasn't in desperate need of anything. If you want a Mac though, head to Myer, who have <a href="https://www.ozbargain.com.au/node/236326">10% off Macs & iPhones</a> this Saturday.</p>

<p><b>The Australian National Address File is now freely available to use</b><br>
A list of every single address in Australia is now free for anyone to use. Previously the list maintained by PSMA, a company formed by the state governments to collate this info, used to cost a fair bit of money for someone to licence. The government realised this probably holds back companies from being agile and innovative, <a href="https://blog.data.gov.au/news-media/blog/g-naf-and-administrative-boundaries-datasets-are-now-open-public-data">so they're now distributing and maintaining G-NAF</a> under Creative Commons, for free. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKig0_gLyCw">PSMA has a little video about what G-NAF is and why it's a good thing</a>.</p>

<p><b>To parity, or not to parity, that is the question</b><br>
This is a pretty niche topic, but some of you might find it interesting. When building a file server, you need to determine what sort of storage redundancy you're going to implement. Sometimes it is no redundancy, sometimes it is a lot. But often you want a good mix of using all the available space in the array and making sure your data isn't toast if a drive fails. <a href="http://jrs-s.net/2015/02/06/zfs-you-should-use-mirror-vdevs-not-raidz/">This blog post I stumbled across explains how making a mirror of a drive is better than parity</a>, even if it does eat up 50% of your storage.</p>
