    <h2>Hello, my name is Anthony and I write The Sizzle</h2>

  	<p>Many years ago I started MacTalk, One More Thing and Reckoner. I've contributed to Delimiter, SMH/The Age, Macworld Australia, PC & Tech Authority, Australian Personal Computer, Drive Zero, Wheels/WhichCar and Media Connect/ITJourno over my decade long stint as a tech writer. Reckoner won the 2014 Optus IT Journalism award for best independent media, which I know was a while ago but I'm proud of it.</p>

	<p>You may also remember me as the guy who <a href="https://delimiter.com.au/2010/04/06/18-ipads-in-one-day-australias-april-ipad-pilgrimage/">went to New York to buy some iPads</a> or who set up a <a href="https://reckoner.com.au/features/my-three-months-as-a-litecoin-farmer/">cryptocurrency mining farm in a shed</a>, or <a href="https://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/nab-shuts-down-qantas-frequent-flyer-credit-card-loophole/news-story/92624b276d834c3c6042921b72116c53">scored a bunch of frequent flyer points off a bank</a>. I used those points on two seperate business class trips around the world and it was heaps of fun.</p>

	<p>I talk a lot of <a href="https://twitter.com/decryption">shit on Twitter</a> and write boring nerdy long form stuff that nobody pays me for over on my blog <a href="https://blog.decryption.net.au">decryption.net.au</a></p>
