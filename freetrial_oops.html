	<h2>Oops!</h2>

	<p>Looks like this link has already been clicked. This happens with Outlook and it's <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/advanced-outlook-com-security-for-microsoft-365-subscribers-882d2243-eab9-4545-a58a-b36fee4a46e2">"Safe Links" feature</a> that pre-emptively clicks links to ensure they're not malware. Unfortuntely it's enabled by default so it clicked that link before you did and I'm too dumb to figure out how to work around it to avoid it triggering the opt-in process.</p>

	<p>If you got an email in your inbox saying Welcome to The Sizzle, then you're in the trial (thanks!) - but if you clicked this link and didn't get that welcome email, please let me know (<a href="mailto:anthony@thesizzle.com.au">anthony@thesizzle.com.au</a>) as something has stuffed up.</p>
