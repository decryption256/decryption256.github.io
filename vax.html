    <h2>Hello, my name is Anthony and I write The Sizzle</h2>

  	<p>Many years ago I started MacTalk, One More Thing and Reckoner. I've contributed to Delimiter, SMH/The Age, Macworld Australia, PC & Tech Authority, Australian Personal Computer, Drive Zero and Media Connect/ITJourno over my decade long stint as a tech writer. Reckoner won the 2014 Optus IT Journalism award for best independent media, which I know was a while ago but I'm proud of it.</p>

	<p>You may also remember me as the guy who <a href="https://delimiter.com.au/2010/04/06/18-ipads-in-one-day-australias-april-ipad-pilgrimage/">went to New York to buy some iPads</a> or who set up a <a href="https://reckoner.com.au/features/my-three-months-as-a-litecoin-farmer/">cryptocurrency mining farm in a shed</a>, or <a href="https://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/nab-shuts-down-qantas-frequent-flyer-credit-card-loophole/news-story/92624b276d834c3c6042921b72116c53">scored a bunch of frequent flyer points off a bank</a>. I used those points on two seperate business class trips around the world and it was heaps of fun.</p>

	<p>I talk a lot of <a href="https://twitter.com/decryption">shit on Twitter</a> and write boring nerdy long form stuff that nobody pays me for over on my blog <a href="https://blog.decryption.net.au">decryption.net.au</a></p>

	<h2>Answers to Questions People Ask</h2>
	<p><strong>What are you going to do with all these COVID-19 digital certificate screenshots?</strong><br>
	I don't want them, they'll be deleted within 24 hours of you submitting the form. I only need the screenshot to verify you're fully vaccinated and to stop people just taking a free 3 months.

	<p><strong>I'd like to get in touch with you, what's the best way to do it?</strong><br>
	Email me, <em><a href="mailto:anthony@thesizzle.com.au">anthony@thesizzle.com.au</a></em> and I'll usually reply in 24-48 hours. If you prefer to chat, add me on Telegram where I am <em>@decryption</em></p>

	<p><strong>Is there an archive of old issues of The Sizzle I can check out?</strong><br>
	Yes! Visit <em><a href="https://archive.thesizzle.com.au">https://archive.thesizzle.com.au</a></em> for previous issues of The Sizzle. It hasn't been updated in a while.</p>

	<p><strong>How do I cancel my subscription?</strong><br>
	Paying subscribers can visit the <a href="javascript:void(0)" data-cb-type="portal" >customer portal</a> to stop the payments and stop receiving The Sizzle. If you haven't paid, just click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any issue of The Sizzle.</p>

	<p><strong>How do I update my email or payment details?</strong><br>
	The almighty <a href="javascript:void(0)" data-cb-type="portal" >customer portal</a> is where this operation can be conducted. Changing emails is manual at the moment while I figure out how to automate it - so for now <a href="mailto:anthony@thesizzle.com.au">please email me</a> if you'd like to change the address where your daily Sizzle is sent.

	<p><strong>Can I move from a monthly to a yearly subscription or vice-versa?</strong><br>
	Yep, you guessed it - <a href="javascript:void(0)" data-cb-type="portal" >customer portal</a>!

	<p><strong>How many people subscribe to The Sizzle?</strong><br>
	As of mid-March 2021, 758 people pay to read The Sizzle. I love them all!</p>

	<p><strong>Is The Sizzle your full-time job?</strong><br>
	I spend half of my weekdays occupied with Sizzle related stuff and the other half as a freelance tech writer, mostly advertorial/sponsored content for various outlets but sometimes product reviews. If you need someone to write tech related words, <a href="mailto:anthony@thesizzle.com.au">please get in touch!</a></p>

	<p><strong>Which platform does The Sizzle operate on?</strong><br>
	<a href="https://tillypay.com/">Chargebee</a> for billing, <a href="https://www.activecampaign.com/au/">ActiveCampaign</a> for sending emails, <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> to tie the two together and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> to host this site on. The vaccination screenshots are uploaded to Amazon S3.</p>
