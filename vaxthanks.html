	<h2>Thanks for subscribing to The Sizzle!</h2>

	<p>You bloody ripper - thank you so much for getting vaccinated. I hope you enjoy the little 3 month gift of The Sizzle. It's not much but it's something I can do as a token of my appreciation for you having made the effort to protect yourself and the wider community against COVID-19.</p>

	<p>I will manually check each screenshot to make sure it's an actual screenshot of a vaccination certificate and then add you to the newsletter list. Give me 24-48 hours after submitting your screenshot to do this. You will get a confirmation email once you've been added to the list. If you don't hear anything from me after a few days, get in touch.</p>

    <p>If you haven't already popped in to <a href="https://communityinviter.com/apps/the-sizzle/the-sizzle">The Sizzle's Slack group</a>, now is a great time to say hello and chat with some fellow subscribers.</p>

	<p>As always, feel free to get in touch about anything, any time: <a href="mailto:anthony@thesizzle.com.au">anthony@thesizzle.com.au</a><br>--Anthony</p>
