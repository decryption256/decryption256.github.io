	<h2>2021 Was A Year</h2>

	<p>The holidays are a great time to reflect on what took place over the last 12 months. Learn from our mistakes, enjoy our triumphs, or simply get red and nude over that thing <em>(insert big tech company you hate the most here)</em> did to upset you.</p>

	<p>I've collected some the best bits of The Sizzle from 2021 and compiled it into monthly summaries, so we can all look back at the shitshow that was 2021 and make sure it never happens again.</p>

	<p>Here's a <a href="https://thesizzle.com.au/01-jan.html">free summary of Janurary</a> as a little taste.</p>

	<p>The other 11 months are located at <a href="https://2021.thesizzle.com.au">https://2021.thesizzle.com.au</a> and locked behind a paywall. To read it simply pay what you feel comfortable and login details will be emailed to you.</p>

	<a class="custom-dbox-popup" href="https://donorbox.org/the-sizzle-reviews-2021"><button>Unlock 2021 Review</button></a>

	<p>50% of your payment will be dontated to <a href="https://cafs.org.au/">Child and Family Services Ballarat</a> - a charity that supports people in need of financial and housing help in my little corner of the world.</p>

	<p>The Sizzle's 2021 year in review will only be on sale until the 10th of January 2022, so act now!</p>
