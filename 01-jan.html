<h1>Janurary 2021</h1>

<h2>News</h2>

    	<h3>Flash's dead, baby. Flash's dead</h3>
            <p>
            	We all knew that Adobe was killing off Flash at 11:59pm on December 31st 2020 - they gave us like 4 years of warning - but just so you know, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/02/adobe-ends-flash-support/">Flash is now dead, like properly dead</a>. Shit, Adobe are even recommending you uninstall it and will actively block content running on Jan 12th. Now that it's been abandoned, leaving Flash on your computer is just asking for trouble because no security patches are gonna come out to fix any security flaws! Luckily I haven't seen any Flash-related stuff on the internet for a while now so it's no big loss day to day. <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2020/11/19/flash-animations-live-forever-at-the-internet-archive/">All those Flash games and experiences will live on in emulators now</a>.

        <h3>Trump bans more Chinese tech companies, this time taking aim at fintechs</h3>
            <p>
            	As the door hits his arse on the way out, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55555269">Donald Trump's administration has slapped more bans on Chinese tech companies</a>. In 45 days it'll be illegal for a US company to do any transactions with "persons that develop or control the apps of Alipay, CamScanner, QQ Wallet, SHAREit, Tencent QQ, VMate, WeChat Pay, WPS Office and its subsidiaries". The US government claims these apps are a national security risk - like every other Chinese app going around. I mean, they're not wrong, technically. Either way, it's yet another executive order that is apparently easy to repeal if Biden wants to.
            </p>

            	<h3>The USA's insurrection and social media's role in it all</h3>
            <p>
            	You've probably already seen all the cooked units storming the US Capitol building, what you also probably saw <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/technology/violence-election-capitol-hill-social-media.html">is a bizarre outcome of unfettered social media</a>. There's many ingredients in the pot that made this gross stew, but social media has undeniably enabled all these like-minded people to easily create groups, meet up and manifest their warped world views into the physical world. <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1346970430062485505?s=20">Twitter</a>, Facebook and YouTube might <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217743/trump-capitol-attack-youtube-video-removed-twitter-facebook-moderation">remove the odd video</a>, or <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/responding-to-the-violence-in-washington-dc/">slap a warning on the President's messages</a>, but the groups persist. Even if they're removed, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/president-trump-facebook-twitter-coup">new groups pop up and gain tens of thousands of members within hours</a>. I don't know if we will look back on this era of social media like the humans in Planet of the Apes, damning all who came before to hell, but something's certainly rotten here.
            </p>

                	<h3>Facebook has banned Trump until the 21st of Jan, Twitch & Shopify follow</h3>
            <p>
            	Well, well, well - <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/07/donald-trump-twitter-ban-comes-to-end-amid-calls-for-tougher-action">Facebook grew a goddamn spine and have banned Donald Trump</a> from posting until the inauguration of Joe Biden on the 21st of Jan, with Zuck justifying it by saying "we believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great". Don't start to think Zuck and Facebook have any morals though, as it's clearly a move to look virtuous whilst also covering their arses now that the Democrats are in political control and starting to regulate the hell out of his business. Facebook's move did give others a push to take out their trash, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22219144/twitch-trump-ban-indefinitely-capitol-attack">Twitch banning Trump from streaming on its platform</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-07/shopify-pulls-plug-on-trump-organization-s-online-store">Shopify closing down Trump's merch store</a>.
            </p>

                	<h3>Trump and his buddies are getting deplatformed all across the internet</h3>
            <p>
            	Soon as Trump got back on Twitter and let loose with some tweets, Twitter made the ban of Trump, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolinehaskins1/twitter-banned-qanon-accounts">along with heaps of MAGA dorks</a> permanent, invoking their <a hgref="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html">Glorification of Violence Policy as justification</a>. With their "freedom of speech" impinged, they ran to Parler, a no-holds barred version of Twitter. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/09/technology/apple-google-parler.html">Apple, Google and Amazon Web Services quickly snuffed Parler out</a>, banning the app from mobile app stores and banishing their code from their servers. Parler is now <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/01/parler-ceo-says-service-dropped-by-every-vendor-and-could-end-the-company-1234670607/">having trouble finding someone to host</a> their hate machine. <a href="https://www.axios.com/reddit-bans-rdonaldtrump-subreddit-ff1da2de-37ab-49cf-afbd-2012f806959e.html">Reddit finally tore down</a> the toxic /r/DonaldTrump. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/stripe-stops-processing-payments-for-trump-campaign-website-11610319116">Stripe joined in the fun too</a>, refusing to accept payments for any Trump's website here he begs supporters for money.
            </p>

                	<h3>YouTube says piss off and don't come back for a week to Donald Trump</h3>
            <p>
            	<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22218757/youtube-trump-account-video-deleted-uploads-suspension-indefinite">YouTube finally came to the party and knocked off some of Trump's videos</a>. Apparently one of his uploads violated their content policies on inciting violence - dunno which one, YouTube isn't saying - but it's one of his post-insurrection uploads. They also removed two videos uploaded to the White House's official channel. Trump's been issued a "strike" on YouTube, which means "the channel is now prevented from uploading new videos or livestreams for a minimum of seven days - which may be extended". I'd be surprised if YouTube doesn't keep him on ice until at least the inauguration of Biden on Jan 20th.
            </p>

                	<h3>Amazon & Facebook on terrorist watch after banning sickos & Australian MPs line up to regulate them</h3>
            <p>
            	<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-cloud-exec-warns-employees-vigilant-after-parler-ban-2021-1">Amazon's VP of Web Services sent out a memo to staff</a> titled "Be safe. Be vigilant" and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/facebook-trump-ban-staff-company-branded-clothing-safety-concerns-2021-1">Facebook sent a similar memo</a> "encouraging everyone to avoid wearing or carrying Facebook-branded items at this time", as both companies are slightly worried about ex-Parler and banned-Facebook users seeking revenge. Australian politicians also didn't like what they saw tech companies do to Trump, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/over-50-aussie-mps-form-group-aimed-at-holding-social-media-companies-accountable">starting a "Parliamentary Friends of Making Social Media Safe" group</a> yesterday that's gained 50 MPs as members already. The aim of the group is to "start the conversation" around potential regulation of online discussions. I can't wait for there to be a new government body to deal specifically with how platforms moderate users. Banned from Whirlpool? Straight to the ombudsman!
            </p>

                	<h3>US government weighs in on Australia's media bargaining code, doesn't like it</h3>
            <p>
            	<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jan/19/us-attacks-australias-extraordinary-plan-to-make-google-and-facebook-pay-for-news">The US government has officially submitted its opinion to an inquiry assessing the News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code</a>. The yanks are shitty about us hobbling two of their most profitable businesses, saying that the code is "fundamentally imbalanced", the collective bargaining aspect is a "a departure from broadly accepted competition principles" and "respectfully request that Australia reconsider whether legislation is needed". They even argue the proposed code will go against article 20.5 of the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement which "requires Australia and the United States to provide for appeals against administrative or bureaucratic decisions". The inquiry starts hearings on Friday, so expect news on this topic to ramp up a bit while the politicians sling shit at each other about it.
            </p>

                	<h3>Facebook claims to not operate in Australia and hold no data on Australians in Australia, so it doesn't need to adhere to privacy laws</h3>
            <p>
            	Australia's privacy commissioner sued Facebook for the mass privacy breach that took place via the whole Cambridge Analytica thing and as part of its defense, Facebook reckons they don't operate a business in Australia and that they don't collect or hold data on Australian users in Australia. Absolute bullshit according to the judge who decided back in September that there's caching servers hosted locally and cookies on millions of Australian devices, so Facebook can't run away from this case. Months later, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jan/19/facebook-asks-to-appeal-court-ruling-that-it-conducts-business-in-australia">Facebook is appealing the decision to the full bench of the Federal court</a>, arguing that "the appeal examines 'important questions' about how privacy laws define what it means to carry on business in Australia and 'collect' or 'hold' personal information". Fucking cowards.
            </p>


            <h3>Anthony Levandowski pardoned by Trump, Assange and Snowden left behind</h3>
            <p>
            	As the door hit Trump's arse on the way out of the White House, he pardoned over 140 people - <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/trump-pardons-anthony-levandowski-for-google-trade-secret-theft/">one of which is Anthony Levandowski</a>. You might remember him as the guy that quit Waymo to start his own startup that was quickly purchased by Uber, and got in trouble for taking Waymo's "trade secrets" with him and used them at Uber. He received an 18 month jail term for this crime, but it was suspended because Levandowski claimed he had health conditions that meant going into jail during the COVID-19 outbreak would put him in danger. Due to the pardon, he will now never have to serve any prison time. It's particularly galling because way more worthy people in the tech scene, like Julian Assange or Edward Snowden were overlooked. Helps to have Trump sycophants Peter Thiel and Palmer Luckey as mates.
            </p>

            <h3>Google threatens to turn off search engine for Australians if media bargaining code becomes law</h3>
            <p>
            	Google's Australian boss has told a Senate hearing deliberating the mandatory media bargaining code that "if this version of the code were to become law, it would give us no real choice but to stop making Google Search available in Australia". <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/google-threatens-to-disable-search-in-australia-if-media-code-becomes-law-20210122-p56w2h.html">Google is literally threatening to turn off its search product in Australia if this proposed code becomes reality</a>. Honestly, I'd love to see it happen, just for shits and giggles. Can you imagine that? Just no Google in Australia. You'd go to type a query into a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/omnibox">browser's omnibox</a> and nuthin'. <a href="https://www.michaelwest.com.au/internets-founder-us-officials-slap-down-news-and-nines-crusade-on-google/">Michael West Media has a great article explaining how perverted this proposed code is</a>. Over in France, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/google-agrees-to-pay-french-news-sites-to-send-them-traffic/">Google has stitched up deals with media companies</a> that keeps both government and media outlets happy
            </p>

                	<h3>Wallstreetbets continues to piss off Wall Street</h3>
            <p>
            	Shit has gotten so out of control thanks to /r/wallstreetbets that Robinhood <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/robinhood-is-said-to-draw-on-credit-lines-from-banks-amid-tumult">stopped trading shares not just in GameStop</a>, but also in AMC (a movie threatre chain), Blackberry (yeah, that Blackberry), Nokia and a few other companies WSB was hyping up. Thousands of pissed off Redditors <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store">left complaints and 1-star reviews on the Google Play Store for the Robinhood app</a> about the trading ban, which Google swiftly deleted under its policy to stop the manipulation of an app's rating. Various hedge funds that bet Gamestop would shit the bed, have in fact, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/hedge-funds-torched-wall-street-bets-gamestop-short-squeeze-reddit-2021-1">shit the bed themselves</a>. This financial tug of war <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-gamestop-squeeze-congress-hearings-002519817.html">has attracted the attention of politicans</a>, with the US Senate Committee on Banking to discuss how the "SEC and Congress to make the economy work for everyone not just Wall Street". Fuck yeah, burn it all down!!!

<h2>Something I Saw On The Internet</h2>

   		<h3>Computers and fried chicken, together at last</h3>
            <p>
            	While I was minding my own business, enjoying a world away from the constant torrent of news, <a href="https://landing.coolermaster.com/kfconsole/">KFC announced the KFConsole</a> - a computer case made in collaboration with Coolermaster, a brand you might be familiar with if you spent your teenage years hanging around Overclockers Australia instead of being a normal kid. The KFConsole's raison d'être is a "chicken chamber", a drawer in which to stash fried chicken and uses the heat generated by your sweet gaming rig to keep said chicken warm. There's no details if you can buy the case on its own or you need to buy it pre-assembled, or even if you can buy it at all. What will the colonel think of next to get free promotion in publications that would otherwise not mention him???
            </p>

               		<h3>A passion project to recreate the ATM hacking program from Terminator 2</h3>
            <p>
            	The scene in Terminator 2 where little John Connor rides his dirt bike to an ATM, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB82FNPoiPM">plugs in a mini Atari palm-top computer to "hack" the PIN on his parents debit card and withdraw $300</a> is one of my earliest memories of "fuck that was a cool scene" in cinema. <a href="https://bert.org/2021/01/04/t2-pin-cracking/">It had the same effect on Bertrand Fan</a>, who made a full SVG homage of the Atari Portfolio, running John Connor's "code". Bertrand didn't stop there, he actually made the program in Turbo Pascal and ran it in DOS Box. It serves absolutely no purpose and I love it.
            </p>

               		<h3>I love large format film and I cannot lie, you other nerds can't deny</h3>
            <p>
            	Melbourne is a great city, but it is the best city because it has something 99% of cities don't - a 15 perf 70mm IMAX film projector! Why is this special? <a href="https://nofilmschool.com/2017/07/christopher-nolan-dunkirk-70mm-release">Look at this infographic comparing the various cinema projection formats available for Dunkirk</a>. A few other cinemas have 6 perf 70mm film projectors and they're lovely, but as you can see in the infographic, the IMAX film is way bigger. There's not many feature films made in 15/70mm film (basically just Christopher Nolan) but the ones that do exist are glorious and are an experience. Forbes has a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bennyhareven/2021/12/31/interview-the-man-keeping-imax-film-alive-down-under--part-1/">two part</a> interview with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bennyhareven/2021/01/10/interview-the-man-keeping-imax-film-alive-down-under--part-2">IMAX Melbourne's projectionist</a> about their unique setup. Melbournians are truly blessed to have such a facility locally. By the way, Interstellar in 15/70mm is showing on Jan 30th. 
            </p>

               		<h3>Two Sizzle subscriber projects I want to tell you about</h3>
            <p>
            	I absolutely love hearing about the projects Sizzle subscribers work on, so I was delighted to get an email from Charlie Gleason last night telling me about an <a href="https://superhighfives.com/pika">open source app he made called Pika</a>. It's a colour picket for macOS that "makes it simple to quickly find colours onscreen, in the format you need, so you can get on with being a speedy, successful designer". I have absolutely no need for it, but it looks cool and useful for people more creative than me. Another Sizzle subscriber called Paul took made a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/au/app/sol-exe-retro-solitaire/id1542164345">faithful reproduction of Solitaire of Windows 3.1 on iOS</a> by using the original cards.dll file! Adorable.
            </p>

               		<h3>Audio Science Review, nerds at their pedantic best</h3>
            <p>
            	Whilst researching a new subwoofer purchase I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/">Audio Science Review</a>, a forum of audiophiles that try and base their product suggestions in some form of evidence rather than woowoo nonsense. The main protagonist of ASR is a bloke called amirm who constantly reviews affordable headphones, speakers, amplifiers and DACs with high-end test equipment. The culmination of his work is in the <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/master-review-index.11398/">Master Review Index</a>, where you can select the kind of product you want and view a big list of recommendations and test results. Let's say you're after a pair of speakers for your study to enjoy some tunes on - <a href="https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?pages/SpeakerTestData/">load up the speaker review index</a> and sort/filter by the criteria you're interested in. Active speakers, under US$500, sorted by amirm's rating results in the Neumann KH 80 DSP at number 1, but the JBL 306P/308P MkII speakers not far behind and way cheaper at US$150/$250. Very handy!
